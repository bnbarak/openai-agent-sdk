# API Reference

The API reference is published from Javadoc. If you are reading this on GitHub Pages,
the API docs will appear under `/api/` once the Javadoc pipeline is wired up.

In the meantime:

- Use the JavaDoc in your IDE.
- Browse the source packages under `src/main/java/com/acoliteai/agentsdk`.
